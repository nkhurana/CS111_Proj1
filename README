CS 111 Lab 1a
Command builder for subset of standard POSIX

We are unaware of any known limitations of our code.

We tokenize the input commands and do syntax checking at a token level. We then
transform the tokens into the appropriate commands.

Lab 1b

There are no limitations on the execution of commands. Parallelization has yet 
to be implemented.

We made execute-command a recursive function that uses fork() and execvp(). We
used pipe() to handle pipe commands.
